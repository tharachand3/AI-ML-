# 🚀 AI-ML Daily Practice Journey

This repository documents my structured daily learning in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

The goal is not just to use models, but to understand concepts clearly and implement them from scratch using real datasets.

## 🎯 What I Am Doing

- Practicing Machine Learning daily
- Implementing concepts with code
- Understanding theory behind models
- Evaluating models properly
- Documenting key revision notes
- Building interview-ready fundamentals

Each folder represents one day of focused learning.
